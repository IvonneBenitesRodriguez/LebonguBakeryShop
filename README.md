🍫 Our website's aim is to make known Lebongu Bakery and Chocolatier.<br/>
🍫 We have a **Navigation Bar** that includes : Home, About, Gallery, Services and Contact Section.<br/>

## 🚀 Technologies used:
I have used a **free Bootstrap template** and I have modified it and added more pages to this template since the template was at first just a landing page. I have used **HTML, CSS and Media Queries to add responsiveness** to this project. <br/>
At first I used **Netlify** to deploy the project.<br/>
I used also **Photoshop** to edit photographs and create images for this project.<br/>
